"This file contains a list mapping anaconda's help_id to anchor in the docs for the online help. This is in the JSON format as a hash table or dictionary. Look at the next pair of values to see the structural elements: Double quotes enclosing the strings, a colon separating them, and a comma to separe from the next pair. Finally the last pair is special in that it does not have the ending comma. This very comment is also another part of the dictionary and follows the same rules.",

"_comment2":
"Please note that at this moment a known issue of yelp causes links to open at chapter start, even if they are nested deeper. This means that the links in yelp open elsewhere than wanted. https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1636437 But we still want to point to the right place, as with this amount of levels the help opens close by, at a ToC listing the wanted thing.",
